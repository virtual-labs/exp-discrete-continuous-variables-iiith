# Procedure for the experiments in the following section

## Part 1
### CDF
<li>
    Click on the button to generate a random number "c".
</li>
<li>
    Find the inverse image of the generated random number "c" for the given random
    variable \(X\) and select the appropriate inverse image.
</li>
<li>
    Based on the inverse image calculated and the probabiliy measure given, find the CDF
    of the random variable \(X\) at "c" and enter the value in the input box.
</li>
<li>
    Click on the "Submit" button to check your answer.
</li>
<li>
    Click on the "Reset" button to reset the experiment.
</li>

### CDF Properties
<li>
    Given: A function \(\mathcal{f}\), a sample space \(\Omega\), and a variable \(c\)
</li>
<li>
    Populate the function \(\mathcal{f}\) and the variable \(c\) using the generate button given
    below
</li>
<li> 
    The generate button will give a random mapping for the function \(\mathcal{f}\) with values
    ranging from \(-7.5\) to \(7.5\)
</li>
<li> 
    Please select the subset of \( \Omega \) which is the inverse image of the generated function
    \(\mathcal{f}\)
</li>			

### CDF to PDF/PMF
<li>
    Click on the button to randomly generate a plot of CDF of a valid RV. Note that the
    only types of RV used here are either continuous Uniform RV of a discrete RV with 5
    non-zero point.
</li>
<li>
    Identify the type of RV from the plot and select from the dropdown.
</li>
<li>
    If you choose continuous RV, enter the PDF value and the range of values of RV in
    which the PDF is non-zero. For example, if the plot is a straight line from (1,0) to
    (2,0), the PDF value here is 1, the leftmost non-zero point is 1 and the rightmost
    non-zero point is 2.
</li>
<li>
    If you choose discrete RV, enter the PMF values in increasing order of value of RV.
</li>
<li>
    Click on the "Submit" button to check your answer.
</li>
<li>
    Click on the "Reset" button to reset the experiment.
</li>

## Part 2
### Bernoulli RV
<li>
    Choose a value for the probability of getting a Head on tossing a coin, denoted by
    \(p\).
</li>
<li>
    Enter the value of \(p\) in the input box and click on the "Set" button.
</li>
<li>
    Click on the "TOSS" button to simulate the coin toss experiment.
</li>
<li>
    Observe the value of the Bernoulli random variable \(X\) for each toss.
</li>
<li>
    Click on the "Reset" button to reset the experiment.
</li>

### Binomial RV

### Geoemetric RV
<li>
    Choose a value for the probability of getting a Head on a coin toss, denoted by
    \(p\).
</li>
<li>
    Enter the value of \(p\) in the input box and click on the "Set" button.
</li>
<li>
    Click on the "TOSS" button to perform the coin toss experiment.
</li>
<li>
    Keep on clicking the "TOSS" button to perform multiple coin tosses until you get the
    first Head.
</li>
<li>
    Observe the value of the Geometric random variable \(X\) for the experiment.
</li>
<li>
    Repeat the experiment multiple times to observe the distribution of the Geometric
    random variable \(X\).
</li>
<li>
    Click on the "Reset" button to reset the experiment.
</li>

### Poisson RV
