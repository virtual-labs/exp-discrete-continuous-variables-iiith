      "question": "1. I roll a fair die repeatedly until a number less than 2 is observed. If $N$ is the total number of times I roll the die, find $P(N = k)$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.",

        "a": "$P(N = k) = \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^k$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This answer ignores that the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is $\\frac{5}{6}$ in the first $k-1$ rolls.",
        "b": "Correct! This follows the geometric distribution where $P(N = k) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^{k-1}$.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This swaps the probabilities of success and failure. The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 should be $\\frac{5}{6}$, not $\\frac{1}{6}$.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This answer confuses the probability of rolling 1 with the overall probability distribution for $N$."

The driving time of 'S' is between 7 to 10 minutes on a sunny day and 30 to 45 minutes on a rainy day, with all times being equally likely in each case.
